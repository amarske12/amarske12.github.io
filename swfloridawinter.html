    <h3>Do's</h3>
    
    <ol>
    <li><strong>Put your artificial lures in storage:</strong> Live bait is king when the water cools. You will never go wrong fishing shrimp as all species will take a bite. Free line, weighted, or on jig. Find what presentation is working that day and stick with it.</li>
    <li><strong>Locate canal mouths and protected waters:</strong> If targeting snook, find protected water. You may think 75 feels like 105 but "cold" fronts do a number on snook feeding habits and location. The gold stars below are examples of canal openings that may hold winter snook. </li>

    <li><strong>Docks, Docks, and more Docks:</strong> Once you find protected, deeper water, target docks and cover. For as aggressive as salt water fish are, they hug cover just like their northern freshwater cousins. 6" to the right or left of a piling may be the difference between you and that giant red that lurks beneath.</li>
    </ol> 

<h3>Don'ts</h3>

<ol>
<li><strong>Fish with plastic:</strong> As mentioned above, <strong>PUT THE LURES AWAY</strong>. Put extra batteries in your bubbler and fish live bait</li>
<li><strong>Shallow Waters:</strong> Shallow water temps fluctuate with the weather. Fish prefer stabler conditions to feed which deeper water provides. If you can, use your fish finder to locate deep holes off of flats near mangroves.</li>
<li><strong>Still water:</strong> Find current and pay attention to tides. Current and tides bring baitfish. Strong swimming fish like Jack and Snook are able to withstand the tides and feast on what comes along with it.</li>
