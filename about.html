<p>While I wasn't old enough to remember, my "Uncle" Tim (my father's best friend from childhood, the best kind of uncle) has always told the story that when I was 2 years old we created a song about doing alot more fishing than we ever did catching. I'll spare the lyrics as I'm sure you can imagine the creativity of a hopelessly bored 2 year old sitting on a concrete retaining wall. Somehow despite the lack of fish, the fishing bug bit and never let go. </p>

<p>My brother, father, and I do a majority of our fishing on a lake 60 miles west of Chicago called Lake Holiday. The majority of the freshwater tactics and tendancies found on this site will be from our experiences fishing that lake. We target Largemouth and Smallmouth all day and channel/flatfhead catfish when the moon is high. We do occasionally fish Lake Michigan shorelines in downtown Chicago harbors for Smallmouth as it has proven to be a mecca for massive fish. Very recently I began fishing the inland waterways of the Gulf Coast in Southwestern Florida. I will include tips and tendancies based on my recent visits.</p>




<p>Created in Winter of 2020, this website is an embarassing display of coding. Even worse than the coding is the fishing advice and stories. Click through the different pages to learn more about what caught fish in the latest season as well as where you can buy it.</p>
