    <h1>Fall Fishing Tactics - Lessons Learned from 2019</h1>
    <h2>Quick review and links to successfull tactics from Sept-Nov 2019</h2>
    <p> As overnight temperatures drop and vegetation withers and dies, bass feeding patterns and behaviors shift. While you may still find success in early fall with summer lures like your whacky rigs and topwaters, as the temperatures fall, bass begin their movements toward deeper water where they will be holding for the winter.  </p>

    <p> By <strong>no means</strong> does this mean the fishing is inactive, in fact it's often the <em>opposite</em>. Fall can be some of the <strong>best</strong> fishing of the year and 2019 was no exception. Below are some of the tactics and tackle we used to find and catch several smallmouth and largemouth through first ice in mid-November.</p>
    
    <h2>Locations</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Rocky points</strong>: Rocks warm quickly in the fall sun. As they heat up, bass will feed up and down the points</li>
        <li><strong>Wind swept points/banks</strong>: Wind carries baitfish into points and banks. Bass will follow their food. </li>
        <li><strong>Tight to structure</strong>: Unpredictable weather patterns including fall rains and sudden drops in temperatures cause fish to seek cover and hug it tight.</li>
    </ul>
